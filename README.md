# GPT-4o-oIP

GPT-4o-oIP is designed to empower developers to create telephony use cases for state-of-the-art multimodal AI models with [Asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)), a powerful open-source private branch exchange. This project aims to reduce setup time and cost by providing preconfigured containers that run locally without subscription. It currently supports Google DialogFlow ES, with future plans to incorporate OpenAI's GPT-4o and Kyutai's Moshi AI when they are released to developers.
